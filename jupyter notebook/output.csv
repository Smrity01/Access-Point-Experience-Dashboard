"Nice video but the information is out of date.\nAs of writing this Amazon doesn't charge a fee anymore to non Prime members to use the Amazon locker in the US. \nAlso you only have 3 days to collect your shipment from the locker after delivery, not 5. \nOf course you're in the UK so maybe Amazon's rules are still different there.", ,420GratefulHippie,0.6731,0,89.6,10.4

"In Japan, you can deliver the package to a convenience store near you and then pick it up from the counter there anytime of the day. I haven't actually tried that, however, as I mostly schedule my packages to be delivered at a specific time slot (e.g. 8-12, 12-14, 14-16... etc). Scheduling will cause a slight delay when compared to the fast shipping provided by Prime (something like half a day later or so).", ,Fanta711,0.0516,3.2,93.2,3.5
