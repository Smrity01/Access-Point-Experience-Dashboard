"This is a wonderful idea. Too bad they aren't everywhere yet. My area recently got prime now, a sort center facility (I got a job there), and I recently found job posting for a mall pop-up store. I'm hoping that means lockers are coming soon. I read that they already have lockers in the other major city in my state that also got a new warehouse last year. So my fingers are crossed that this experience comes near me soon!\n\nAlso there are rumors that Amazon is looking to tap into gas stations. I could see them partnering with a company like BP and having a pop-up/locker set up along with regular convenient store offerings. With the many BP gas stations in the US they could certainly have a major physical stretch throughout the US.",GB,Leo Theo,0.8356,2.6,87.4,10.0,2017-06-14 15:19:53

I find the PassMyParcel service is far better. Today when I used Amazon Locked I have 2 orders and was given two codes. The 2nd coda failed.I then wondered if it was possible that both orders were in the same locker. The only way I could test this was to open my parcels in the shopping centre and yes I did have every thing but a bed experience and I won't use it again.,UK,Robert Fletcher,0.4854,0.0,92.4,7.6,2017-03-26 00:00:58
"I don't know how long we've had it in the states, but I discovered it last year. I got a ""new"" Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, but it didn't contain a unifying receiver. So, I dreaded doing it, but I decided to send it back, even though getting a receiver would cost $10. \n\nI noticed one of the shipping options was an Amazon locker. And there happened to be one close to me, in the mall downtown in Indianapolis. So I chose this option, drove down to the mall after 8pm (free street parking) and set off to try and find the thing. \n\nIt said it was in the Carson Pirie Scott, which is fine, except that it's the biggest store in the mall, at 3-4 floors.  It wound up being on the 3rd floor behind the boys section, in a room. I looked, but there was no sign saying, ""Beware of the Leopard"" outside that room.\n\nI walked up, I scanned my package (with a new return label on the outside) and it opened a door for me to put it in. But it was too small. They had thought of this, and I pushed a button, closed the door, and a bigger door opened and I fit my package in.  All in all, a neat experience. But if it is out of the way, even like this (I don't do malls, really) it's almost too much of a hassle. \n\nLooking now, and Amazon now has 8 places in the Indianapolis area, one is pretty close to where I work.  NOW I would definitely use it again.",US,William Eby,0.9222,3.5000000000000004,87.2,9.3,2017-03-25 03:20:41

"This is definitely a positive addition to Amazon's services as they continue to grow. I personally love to order online, but I hate the uncertainty over whether a package is delivered to me or at the apartment complex office. Even when packages require signature anybody can walk up and sign for a package. So even when I have Amazon's convenient  same day, next day, and 2 day deliveries to allow myself to me available throughout my day off there is still that concern that my package will get stolen. Whenever I see ""USPS"" I know without a doubt that the package will be sent to the office unless it's extremely small to fit in the extremely small mailboxes. You would think that this would be the safest location when getting deliveries. That might be the case in some apartment complexes. However, I live in one where anyone could just walk in and grab the package. I remember the one time this happened when I went to pick up a packaged that showed delivered m package was placed on the floor not far from the entrance that I came in. All it would have taken is the office worker to leave the door open/unlocked while going some place else for someone to snatch my package. There was a time where I've gone inside the office building and nobody was in the office, but the doors were open. So I am aware of those possibilities. Whenever I see UPS or Fedex I'm relieved because most times they will make door visits and plus they allow you to have your package picked up at the facility.\n\nI see what they're doing with this Locker thing which is awesome, but I can see a point where much larger lockers could be place specifically in fulfillment centers. Could you imagine ordering something from Amazon that is at a Fulfillment Center already and being able to pick it up in less than an hour. That would be remarkable. Heck they can go the extra mile and do what Walmart and other retail/grocery competitors are doing with the drive-thru/up pick-up.Front-End associates could delivery packages right to someone's back seat or trunk.",UK,Leo Theo,0.9636,3.7,86.8,9.5,2016-10-06 07:41:45
