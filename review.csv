Nope  - you can only get things sent to lockers that anyone can order. Restricted items - e.g. knives have to be sent to the home address. Next.,GB,Techmoan,-0.3818,9.4,90.60000000000001,0.0,2017-06-14 23:17:41,2017-06-14 23:17:41
"Thank you for sharing this video, we recently got the Amazon Lockers at our local grocery stores around the US. And your video helped me to know what to expect and how easy it is to use!

"Well I'm an American, but if I weren't comfortable with leaving packages on my porch while I'm not home (many Americans aren't, but I have cameras on mine so I'm not worried), or if I didn't have Prime I  would consider using this because I could pick up packages in Chicago. In some circumstances this would cut a day or two out of shipping time (3, on a weekend or holiday). I'm just over the border, in Indiana, only a 30 minute drive from Chicago, and I often have other things to do there anyway. Prime makes my packages come so quickly that it's pointless for me, but it WOULD be helpful for packages coming from companies other than Amazon...",US,s0nicfreak,-0.2389,5.2,90.3,4.3999999999999995,2016-07-30 02:11:36,2016-07-30 02:11:36

To celebrate the fact that Youtube.com/techmoan has passed 20 Million Views and as a result has wasted over 125 years of mankind's time watching my videos - I've decided to make a few old unlisted videos public (because I don't have time to do anything better right now).
